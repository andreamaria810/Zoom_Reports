            <div>Category: Session Quality - Tutor Knowledge Gaps</div>
            <div>LLM Reason: VALID: The tutor is dismissing the student's ability to respond based on their current knowledge level. This suggests a gap in the tutor's understanding of the student's progress, which reflects a potential issue in session quality related to recognizing what the student has learned.</div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="risk-item">

            <div>Keywords: lost</div>
            <div>Category: Session Quality - Not Understanding Material</div>
            <div>LLM Reason: VALID: The student's response indicates a lack of understanding of the material related to the Ottoman Empire's fall and the significance of choosing sides in the war, as they oversimplify the complex historical context and events leading to the empire's dissolution.</div>

            <div>Keywords: guarantee, guaranteed</div>
            <div>Category: Tutor Policy Breach - Over-Promising</div>
            <div>LLM Reason: VALID: The text suggests that there was an expectation of a guaranteed future associated with a role, which indicates that someone may have over-promised in terms of the outcomes or benefits of the role, leading to a potential policy breach regarding realistic expectations for students or parents.</div>

            <div>Category: Session Quality - Tutor Knowledge Gaps</div>
            <div>LLM Reason: VALID: The tutor's response indicates a lack of clarity and structure, which may suggest knowledge gaps in effectively conveying the material. The transitions between points are unclear, making it difficult for the student to follow the logic and understand the larger perspective being presented.</div>

        <div class="risk-item">
            <div class="timestamp">01:06:44.940</div>

            <div>Keywords: pay attention</div>
            <div>Category: Session Quality - Lack of Engagement</div>
            <div>LLM Reason: VALID: The text illustrates a lack of engagement as the initial query about the use of slaves does not follow the context or focus on the main topic being introduced (the Columbian Exchange). The response seems to divert from the importance of Unit 4, indicating a disengagement from the conversation.</div>
